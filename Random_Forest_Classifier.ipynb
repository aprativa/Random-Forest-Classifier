    "The current scale used by to measure the severity of a tropical cyclone or a hurricane that is used by the National Hurricane Center(NHC) is called the *Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale*. It was developed in the early 1970's by Herbert Saffir and is strictly a wind scale.[3] The scale categorizes the severity of a hurricane on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 meaning minor damage and 5 being life threatening. The post-storm analysis conducted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) contains each tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basis which comprises of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea and the North Pacific Ocean. The dataset consists of snapshots of a given hurricane from 1851-2014 over intervals of time during its entire lifespan. The dataset does not have a prelabeled Category Column. The purpose of this project is to build a classification model that accurately categorizes the hurricanes strength and to find other variables that may play a role in determining the severity of a hurricane."

The two main variables that were identified from this analysis were `Maximum Wind` and `Minimum Pressure`. While an accurate classification model was built, the presence of so many null values in a lot of the rows may explain why more significant indicators of the severity of a hurricane were not found. It was also identified that the `lifetime` of the hurricane could be a potential indicator of hte severity of the hurricane. While the `lifetime` of the hurricane seemed to have a slight effect on the `Category` of the hurricane, it was not very significant."
